The My Mobile Workers platform will allow their users to categories items based on their type. For example, a pipe would be placed in a 'Drainage' category or guttering would be placed in a 'Rainwater' category.

The API documentation provided by My Mobile Workers is available [here](https://docs.mymobileworkers.com/index.php?title=Get_Categories).
