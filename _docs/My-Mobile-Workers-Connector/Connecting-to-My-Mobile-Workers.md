All of the available tasks in the My Mobile Workers library require a valid connection. This means prior to using the connector, you will have to create a connection. For more information on creating and managing connections see [Managing Connections](managing-connections).

The API documentation provided by My Mobile Workers is available [here](https://docs.mymobileworkers.com/index.php?title=Connecting_to_the_API).

Your My Mobile Workers account manager will provide you with an API key. This is the information you will use to create your connection.
