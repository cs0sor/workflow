The task list consists of a series of individual tasks that together form the integration's process. Refer to the instructions below for instructions on how to manipulate the task list in a workflow.

## Adding a Task

1. Open the 'Tasks' tab on the left side of the application. Note that the 'Tasks' tab is disabled or greyed out when you don't have a workflow open. You will either need to open an existing workflow, or [Creating New Workflows](creating-new-workflows).
2. Choose a task from the 'Tasks' tab and either **double click** the task or **drag and drop** the task into the task list in the workflow editor pane.

**Note:** The Task Library is only available to customers using a full Zynk license, the Zynk Runtime license does not provide access to the Task Library.

## Removing a Task

1. Select the task to be removed from the workflow.
2. Click on **Delete Task** button on the toolbar in the workflow editor pane.
3. Zynk will ask you to confirm you want to remove the task. Click 'Yes' to confirm.

Note that once a task has been removed from a Workflow it cannot be undone.

## Disabling a Task
To disable a Task **click** on the **check box** next to the tasks name in the **Workflow editor** pane. This will prevent the task from running, without removing it from the workflow.

## Cloning a Task
To clone a task, select the Task from the **Workflow editor** pane and click on the **Copy Task** button in the toolbar, this will create an exact copy of the Task including all of the Task settings.

## Drag and Drop a Task
The basic sequence involved in drag-and-drop is:

1. Press, and hold down, the left button on the mouse, to "grab" the Task from the Task Library
2. Drag the object/cursor to the Tasks workflow pane
3. Drop the object onto the Tasks workflow pane by releasing the button.

## Changing the Order of Tasks
To change the order of a task, select the task you want to move and click on the **Move Up** or **Move Down** buttons on the **Workflow editor** toolbar.

Note you cannot move a task into a repeater, a task must be dragged and dropped onto a repeater.
