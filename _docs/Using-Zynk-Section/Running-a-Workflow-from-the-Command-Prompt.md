title: Running a Workflow from the Command Prompt
---
You can easily start a Workflow without launching the Zynk user interface, using the Command Prompt.

Type the path to the Zynk executable file (Zynk.exe) (if you are typing this command from outside of the Zynk install folder you will have to provide the full path to the Zynk application) followed by "/r" followed by the full path to the Workflow you would like to run.

### Examples
**Zynk V1** - "c:\Program Files\Internetware\Zynk\Zynk.exe" "/r" "c:\ProgramData\Internetware\Zynk\1.0\My Workflows\<*workflow  name*>.wkf"

**Zynk V2** - "c:\Program Files (x86)\Zynk Software\Zynk\2.0\Zynk.exe" "/r"  "c:\ProgramData\Zynk Software\Zynk\2.0\My Workflows\<*workflow  name*>.wkf"
