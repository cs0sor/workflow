The Auto Mapper task can be used to automatically map the data contained in XML files to a format of your choice. For example, you could use the Auto Mapper to transform the orders downloaded from an e-commerce website to Zynk's own XML format.

Please refer to the mainÂ [Auto Mapper](auto-mapper) task page for details of how to use the Auto Mapper.
