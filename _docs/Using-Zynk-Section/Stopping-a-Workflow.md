title: Stopping a Workflow
---
To stop a workflow that is currently running click on the Stop Workflow button on the main toolbar.

Please note that some tasks cannot be stopped whilst they are running (for example where it is executing a query on a remote server). When this is the case, the workflow will stop once the currently running task has finished.
