title: Connecting To WordPress
---


All of the tasks in the WordPress connector require a connection to a WordPress company, so you will need to create a connection with the type 'WordPress'.  See [Managing Connections](managing-connections) for instructions on creating a new connection.



Currently, Zynk only supports connecting to WordPress using an application password, so you will need to install the [Application Passwords](https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/application-passwords/) plugin on your WordPress site.



You will see a screen like the one below, requesting your WordPress details:

Enter your WordPress details as described below, then click 'Finish' to create the connection.
