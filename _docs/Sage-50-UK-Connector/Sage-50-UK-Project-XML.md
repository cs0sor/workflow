Import Projects allows you to create new and update existing Projects in Sage 50. 

Any Sage fields not documented below are not explicitly supported with our imports.

Sample file for importing/updating a Project:

```xml

In each of the following sections, most of the XML has been omitted to make the samples easier to read. The whole structure of the Zynk XML Company schema is used below, as a reference of where fields should be in the object model.
