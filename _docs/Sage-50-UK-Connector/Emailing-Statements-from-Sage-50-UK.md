The email address the emails will appear from (e.g. noreply@mycompany.com)

### HTML Body
_Required_

### Ignore Restrict Mail Flag

### Include Negative Balances
_Required_  
Set to true to send statements to customers with a negative balance on their account, or false to exclude such customers.

### Strong Validation
_Required_  
Set to true to only send the email if the customer's email address was successfully validated against the destination SMTP server, or false to still send the email if it was not possible to validate the email addresses against the server. This setting only takes effect when the 'Validate Against SMTP Server' setting is set to true.

### Subject
_Required_  
The subject for the emails

### Validate Against SMTP Server
_Required_  
Set to true to validate the customer email addresses against the destination SMTP server before trying to send the email, or false to perform only basic validation on the format of the email address.

### Send Failure Notification
_Required_  
Set to true if you would like to be sent a notification if a statement could not be sent due to an invalid customer email address or an email send error. The notification includes the statement as an attachment.

### Send To
_Optional_  
The email address to send the failure notification email to. You can specify a list of email addresses if you would like to send the same email to multiple recipients. A list can be provided either as a comma separated list, or by chosing the ['List' data type](zynk-objects#list-data-type) and entering each address separately.

### Frequency
_Required_  
How frequently to send the statements.

 * **Manual** - To send statements every time the task runs
 * **Weekly** 
 * **Monthly** 
 * **Quarterly**

### Next Send Date
_Required_  
When the frequency is not set to 'Manual', this is the date statements will next be sent. This will be updated automatically when the statements are sent. |

### Add Background
_Required_  
Set to true to add a background to the statements generated. For example, this could be used to include a letterhead or watermark in the invoices.

### Background File
_Optional_  
The file to use as the background to the statements generated.

### Report File
_Required_  
The Sage .report/.layout file to use to generate the statements e.g. `C:\ProgramData\Sage\Accounts\2013\Company.000\Layouts\EMASTOS.layout`

### Use Test Mode
_Required_  
Set to true to send the invoices to the 'From' address instead of the customer's address, and to prevent the printed and emailed flags being updated in Sage. This should be used during testing to prevent customers receiving the emails, and to allow you to view them for yourself.
