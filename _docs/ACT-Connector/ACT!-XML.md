To integrate with [ACT!](act) using Zynk you will need to import and export data using XML. Â We have created a common XML schema to allow you to easily integrate your systems with Sage.

We recommend that you read the [Zynk XML Overview](zynk-xml-overview) before continuing as this contains some generic information on the XML object model, alternatively, choose the task relevant to your integration:

 * [ACT! Company XML](act-company-xml)
 * [ACT! Contact XML](act-contact-xml)
