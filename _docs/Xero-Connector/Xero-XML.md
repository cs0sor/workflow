To integrate with [Xero](xero) using Zynk you will need to import and data using XML.  Tasks in Zynk use the [Xero Accounting API](https://developer.xero.com/documentation/api/api-overview) along with the [Xero C# SDK](https://developer.xero.com/documentation/libraries/using-the-xero-api-with-c).  The Xero documentation can be used as a reference for field names and types, but the overall XML structure needs to be in our defined format.

 * [Xero Contact XML](xero-contact-xml)
 * [Xero Credit Note XML](xero-credit-note-xml)
 * [Xero Invoice XML](xero-invoice-xml)
 * [Xero Item XML](xero-item-xml)
 * [Xero Purchase Order XML](xero-purchase-order-xml)
