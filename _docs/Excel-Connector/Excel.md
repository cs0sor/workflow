The Excel Connector provides a number of tasks that allow you to parse and manipulate Excel files and perform tasks for each record in that file.

In order to read the Excel files, the connector uses an OLEDB provider which is installed as part of the Microsoft Office installation. If Microsoft Office is not installed on the machine running Zynk, the OLEDB provider can be downloaded from theÂ [Microsoft Download Center](http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=13255).
