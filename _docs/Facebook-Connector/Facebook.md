## Connecting to Facebook
All of the tasks within the Facebook library require a connection to Facebook. To instantiate your connection, create a new Facebook connection in the connection manager form. Hit the 'Login' button to open the login form for Facebook and once successfully logged in, your access token will be automatically pasted in to the text box on the form.
