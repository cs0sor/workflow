title: Importing Payments To QuickBooks Online
---


This task will insert new and update existing payments in Quickbooks Online, from an XML file. The logic surrounding inserting/updating payments works as follows:


1. If an Id is provided for the payment, and aÂ payment already exists in Quickbooks with this Id, the existing payment will be updated.
2. If an ExternalId is provided for the payment, and a match is found in Zynk's truth table, the existing payment will be updated.
3. If none of the above conditions are fulfilled, a new payment will be created.
