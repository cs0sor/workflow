This task is used in conjunction with 'If' tasks, such as the [If File Exists](if-file-exists) task. It will run a series of sub-tasks when the condition from the previous 'If' task is not met. Sub-tasks can be added by dragging tasks from the Task Library and onto the Else Task in the workflow. This task does not have any settings other than the standard settings common to all tasks.
