When used within a [Repeater Task](tasks), this task will stop the repeater at the current file/record that is being processed. This will prevent any files/records that have not yet been processed from being processed. This task doesn't have any settings other than the common settings found on all tasks.

This task would typically used as a sub-task of an 'If' task, to stop a repeater under certain conditions.
