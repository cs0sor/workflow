title: Container Task
---
This task simply acts as a container for a group of tasks, and therefore does not have any options. It can be used to group related tasks together, to help make your workflow easier to understand. To add tasks to a container, just drag and drop them onto the container task. You can also rename the container task to aid understanding of what its sub-tasks do, by editing the Task Name in the Task Settings pane.

Note that this task does not count towards the maximum number of tasks allowed in your workflow, so you can add as many as you want.
