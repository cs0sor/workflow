If you are moving Zynk from one machine to another, you will need to go to Help > About within Zynk and email the exact version to us atÂ [support@zynk.com](mailto:support@zynk.com) so we are able to send you the correct .exe file for re-install.

You should backup your existing Zynk data directories. Depending on the version of Windows you are running on this can be found in one of the following locations:

In Windows XP or earlier: C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Zynk Software\Zynk\2.0\ In Windows Vista or Later: C:\ProgramData\Zynk Software\Zynk\2.0\

After re-installing you will need to browse to either of the locations above on the new machine and replace the 2.0 folder with the data copied previously.

When you are ready to start using Zynk you will need to contact us so we can disable the license to allow the software to be activated on the new machine.

**Please note that if Zynk Software did not build the integration then you should contact your developers to ensure all data/files are copied from and to the relevant locations.**
