CalculationÂ of VAT can cause a number of strange rounding issues and this example below shows the correct and incorrect methods of calculating VAT from a gross price.

Figures are shown at 15% VAT for the purpose of this example, you should use the correct VAT rate which at this time is 20%

## Incorrect calcuation method

 * Total Gross Price = 14.99
 * Take off VAT = 13.0347
 * Round to 2dp = 13.03
 * Add back VAT = 14.9845
 * Round to 2dp = 14.98

## Correct calcuation method

 * Total Gross Price = 14.99
 * Take off VAT = 13.0347
 * Do not round the value = 13.0347
 * Add back VAT = 14.989905
