All of the tasks in the [Peoplevox](peoplevox) connector require a connection to a Peoplevox instance, so you will need to create a connection with the type 'Peoplevox'. SeeÂ [Managing Connections](managing-connections) for instructions on creating a new connection. You will see a screen like the one below, requesting your Peoplevox details:
