You can use the Zip Search extension to loop through a series of zip files to find a certain match. This can be useful when troubleshooting an issue with a certain order, or trying to locate the XML for a certain product.

## Settings
### Workflow / Custom Directory
_Required_  
You are required to configure this setting to either a workflow you're investigating or a custom directory containing your archives. Please note, if you are using a custom data directory in Zynk you will need to use the 'Custom Directory' option.

### Input
_Required_  
The text you would like to search for in your .zip files. You can optionally specify multiple values by comma separating. E.g, 'OK,YES,NO'.

## Examples
Below is an example of using the 'Workflow' option using Zip Search. After clicking 'Search' after specifying the workflow archives I'm targeting and the input I'm looking for, you'll see the results list box populate with all .zip files containing the input.
