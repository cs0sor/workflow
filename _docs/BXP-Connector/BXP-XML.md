To integrate with [BXP](bxp) using Zynk you will need to import and export data using XML. Â We have created a common XML schema to allow you to easily integrate your systems with BXP.

We recommend that you read the [Zynk XML Overview](zynk-xml-overview) before continuing as this contains some generic information on the XML object model, alternatively, choose the task relevant to your integration:

 * [BXP Record XML](bxp-record-xml)
