The SQLite connector allows you to execute direct queries against an SQLite database.

Each of the tasks require a connection to an SQLite database, for more information on setting up and managing connections see [Connecting to an SQLite Database](connecting-to-an-sqlite-database).

Knowledge of SQL is required to use the tasks in this connector. You can find tutorials on SQL at [W3 Schools](http://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp). 

## Tasks

* [SQLite Execute Scalar](sqlite-execute-scalar)
