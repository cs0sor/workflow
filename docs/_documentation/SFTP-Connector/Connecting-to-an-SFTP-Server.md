## Connecting to an SFTP Server
All of the tasks in the SFTP Connector require an SFTP connection, so you will need to create a connection with the type 'SFTP'. SeeÂ [Managing Connections](managing-connections) for instructions on creating a new connection. You will see a screen like the one below, requesting your SFTP server details:

Enter you SFTP details as described below, then click 'Finish' to create the connection. Please note that when the workflow is connecting to an SFTP server, you may be prompted to allow the connection. In order to be able to run the workflow on a schedule, you must tick the option to always allow the connection, otherwise the connection to the server will be blocked.
