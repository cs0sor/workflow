title: Deleting Files with FTP
---
The FTP Delete task will remove a file from a remote FTP server

## Settings
### FTP Connection
_Required_  
The FTP Connection to deleteÂ from. See the [Connecting to an FTP Server](connecting-to-an-ftp-server) article here if you require more information on how to create/manage connections.  

### Directory
_Required_  
Initial Directory to move to on FTP Server e.g. `/webdata`.  It is important that you use the 'Text or script' data type instead of 'Folder, HTTP or FTP location' for this setting. This will prevent Zynk treating it as a relative path and converting it to an absolute path on the local file system.  

### Filename
_Required_  
Name of file to be deleted e.g. `web_orders.xml`.  It is important that you use the 'Text or script' data type instead of 'File' for this setting. This will prevent Zynk treating it as a relative path and converting it to an absolute path on the local file system.
