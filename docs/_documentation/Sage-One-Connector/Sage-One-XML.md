To integrate with [Sage One](sage-one) using Zynk you will need to import and export data using XML. Â We have created a common XML schema to allow you to easily integrate your systems with Sage One.

We recommend that you read the [Zynk XML Overview](zynk-xml-overview) before continuing as this contains some generic information on the XML object model, alternatively, choose the task relevant to your integration:

 * [Sage One Customer XML](sage-one-customer-xml)
 * [Sage One Product XML](sage-one-product-xml)
 * [Sage One Purchase Invoice XML](sage-one-purchase-invoice-xml)
 * [Sage One Sales Invoice XML](sage-one-sales-invoice-xml)
 * [Sage One Service XML](sage-one-service-xml)
 * [Sage One Stock Item XML](sage-one-stock-item-xml)
