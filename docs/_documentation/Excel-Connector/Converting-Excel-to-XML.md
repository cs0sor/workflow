title: Converting Excel to XML
---
This task will convert an Excel spreadsheet into an XML file. The file generated can then be used as the input to other tasks, for example anÂ [XSLT Transform](xslt-transform) could be used to convert the XML to the Zynk XML format, ready for import into Sage.

## Settings
### Include Headers
_Required_  
Set this to true if the input file contains a header row. This will stop the row being included in the output file and name the XML nodes according to the column headers.  This will be defaulted to true.	  

### Input File
_Required_  
An absolute or relative file path on the local computer or network to the Excel file to convert.  See the [Zynk Objects](zynk-objects) article if you require more information on how the Zynk Object file value works.  This will be defaulted to the 'Output from the previous task'

### Worksheet Name
_Required_  
The name of the worksheet in the Excel file that needs to be converted.

### Output File
_Required_  
An absolute or relative file path on the local computer or network to save the converted XML file to.  See the [Zynk Objects](zynk-objects) article if you require more information on how the Zynk Object file value works.  This will be defaulted to `excel_to_xml.xml` in the current working directory.

### Zynk Settings
See [Common Task Settings](common-task-settings)
