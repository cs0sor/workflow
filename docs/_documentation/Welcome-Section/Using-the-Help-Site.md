In order to make it easier to understand and identify information that is relevant to you on the Zynk Workflow help site, we will make use of the following sections.

Descriptions will be displayed in green boxes and will provide a high level explanation of the thing being discussed.

Developer information will be displayed in grey boxes. This will describe how the thing being discussed works and what it's default value will be.

Any things to bear in mind will be displayed in yellow boxes. This could include settings that impact each other's behaviour.
