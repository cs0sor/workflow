WARNING. BEFORE PROCEEDING PLEASE READ THE TERMS OF THIS LICENCE AGREEMENT CAREFULLY. ALL INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS SUBSISTING IN THE ENCLOSED SOFTWARE, INCLUDING ANY DOCUMENTATION, AND AUTHORISED COPIES ARE OWNED BY US. IT IS UNLAWFUL TO LOAD THE SOFTWARE INTO A COMPUTER WITHOUT OUR LICENCE. WE ARE WILLING TO LICENSE THE SOFTWARE TO YOU ONLY ON THE CONDITION THAT YOU ACCEPT ALL THE TERMS CONTAINED IN THIS LICENCE AGREEMENT. BY BREAKING THE SEAL ON THE DISK ENVELOPE AND USING THE SOFTWARE YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THESE TERMS WE ARE UNWILLING TO LICENSE THE SOFTWARE TO YOU AND YOU SHOULD NOT OPEN THE DISK ENVELOPE. IN SUCH CASE YOU SHOULD, WITHIN 14 DAYS OF PURCHASE, RETURN THE UNOPENED DISK ENVELOPE AND ALL ACCOMPANYING ITEMS TO US OR YOUR SUPPLIER WITH PROOF OF PURCHASE FOR A FULL REFUND.

### 2 LICENCE

2.1 This Licence Agreement contains the terms on which we permit you to use the Software.

2.2 You only have the right to use the Software if the Software has been licensed to you by us or by our authorised distributor or if you have received a valid assignment from someone else (a "Former Owner").

2.3 If you do not have a right to use the Software as set out above, you must not use it, or attempt to assign or grant any licence to anyone else. If you attempt to do so, you will be breaking the law and you may be subject to criminal proceedings.

2.4 If you received the Software from a Former Owner, you cannot obtain any greater rights to use the Software than they themselves had. If you fail to obtain the rights you expected, your remedy will be to issue proceedings against the Former Owner. For example, if the Former Owner did not hold a valid licence you will obtain no rights to use the Software from him or her.

4.2 You may copy the Software for backup, archival and other security purposes and make up to two copies of the documentation (if any) accompanying the Software provided that you keep the original and each copy in your possession, that your installation and use of the Software falls within the permitted use set out in this Licence Agreement and that all copyright notices and any other proprietary notices found on the original are reproduced on any such copies or partial copies.

4.3 This Licence Agreement allows you to transfer the Software to another person, on a permanent basis only, provided that all copies of the Software are transferred to that person and/or copies not transferred are destroyed and that the other person agrees to the terms of this Licence Agreement.
