title: Introduction to the Salesforce Connector
---


The Salesforce connector provides tasks to read (query), update, create, upsert (insert or update) and delete functionality against any Salesforce object (e.g. Account, Opportunity) as well as custom objects and custom fields.



In order to use the Salesforce connector in Zynk, your Salesforce edition must provide access to the web service API. All Salesforce data is transferred over a secure HTTPS connection, using the same encryption as the Salesforce web application.



Each of the tasks require a connection to Salesforce, for more information on setting up and managing connections see the page [Connecting to Salesforce](606-connecting-to-salesforce) or [Connecting to Salesforce (Bulk)](607-connecting-to-salesforce-bulk) depending on the task.
