The ODBC connector allows you to execute direct queries against any ODBC data source installed on the PC.

Each of the tasks require a connection to an ODBC data source, for more information on setting up and managing connections see the page [Connecting to an ODBC Database](connecting-to-an-odbc-database).

Knowledge of SQL is required to use the tasks in this connector. You can find tutorials on SQL at [W3 Schools](http://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp).
