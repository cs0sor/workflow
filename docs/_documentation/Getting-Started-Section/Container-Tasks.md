You can use container tasks in Zynk to organise your workflow. In this example, I have a workflow that is downloading orders from [Amazon Marketplace](amazon-marketplace) in to [[Sage 50 UK](sage-50-uk) and uploading inventory to Amazon.

I have grouped my tasks in to Download and Upload sections, as shown below.
