title: Set Error Flag
---
This task will set the workflow's error flag to true. This can be used to as a sub-task within an if task, to control when a workflow report is generated and sent via email (provided the 'Email Workflow Report' setting on the 'Properties' tab is set to 'OnErrorFlag'). The task does not have any settings, other than the standard settings common to all tasks.
