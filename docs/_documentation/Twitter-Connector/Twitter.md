The Twitter connector for Zynk allows you to easily integrate with your Twitter account. It provides tasks to automate the publishing of tweets and download favourites, followers, messages and your timeline.

## Tasks

* [Downloading Followers from Twitter](downloading-followers-from-twitter)
* [Downloading Following from Twitter](downloading-following-from-twitter)
* [Downloading Mentions from Twitter](downloading-mentions-from-twitter)
* [Downloading Profile from Twitter](downloading-profile-from-twitter)
* [Downloading Timeline from Twitter](downloading-timeline-from-twitter)
* [Uploading Tweets to Twitter](uploading-tweets-to-twitter)

## Connecting to Twitter

All of the tasks in the Twitter connector require a connection to Twitter, so you will need to create a connection with the type 'Twitter'. See [Managing Connections](managing-connections) for instructions on creating a new connection. You will see a screen like the one below, asking you to log in to Twitter:
