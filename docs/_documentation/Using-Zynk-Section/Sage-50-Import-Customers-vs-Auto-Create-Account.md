title: Sage 50   Import Customers vs Auto Create Account
---
A common query with our support team is the difference between using a separate Import Customers task than the Auto Create Account setting on the Import Sales Orders.

## Import Customers
We'd advise using the Import Customers task if you require more specific contact details about your customers, i.e telephone number, email address, address information etc. Also, if you require any information pushing back to your e-commerce platform or third party system from Sage, this would be the best available option for you.

For more information see [Importing Customers into Sage 50 UK](importing-customers-into-sage-50-uk).

## Auto Create Account
Alternatively, you can use the Auto Create Account if you're not necessarily worried about recording a lot of information on your customers, it's just more important to get your orders into Sage 50. For many people considering this option, it might be a better idea to use a generic account for all your web sales rather than importing several customer accounts.
