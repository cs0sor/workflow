The Query Designer provides a visual, point and click user interface for building SQL queries. It is available on most tasks which require an SQL query, see below for a list of the tasks it can be used on.

## Accessing the Query Designer
The Query Designer can be accessed from within a supported task's settings. In this example, the MS SQL Select task is being used. Click the 'Query' setting, then the ellipsis (...) button that appears next to it.

Click the 'Query Design' button to launch the Query Designer. Please note that this button will only appear on task settings which support the Query Designer. You must select a connection in the task settings before you can use the Query Designer.

4. Configure any aggregate functions, aliases, sorting, grouping or criteria for each column here.
5. You can manually edit the SQL query generated by the designer here, if required.
