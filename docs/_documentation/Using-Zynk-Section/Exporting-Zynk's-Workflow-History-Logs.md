title: Exporting Zynk's Workflow History Logs
---
The History tab lets you review the logs from each run of a Workflow, providing you with a closer look at the work done by each task in the Workflow.

To export the logs for a particular Workflow run, you must first open the Workflow in Zynk.

Once the Workflow is open in Zynk, navigate to the History tab and select the Workflow History entry you would like to export the logs for and click Export Logs.
