title: Running a Workflow

To Run a Workflow, first ensure you have a workflow loaded. If you do not have a workflow loaded the 'Run' option is disabled.

Click on the Run button, the Output pane will be displayed once the workflow starts and you should be able to follow the progress on the progress bar at the bottom of the screen.

Once the workflow has completed, the Output pane should say Workflow Completed. If any errors have occurred they will be displayed in the Errors pane and will display the number of errors that have occurred e.g. Errors(2).
